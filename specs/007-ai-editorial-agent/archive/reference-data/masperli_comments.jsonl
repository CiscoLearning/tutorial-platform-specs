{"body":"@markopec-csco, confirmed that SAST acronym expanded term has been changed to \"Static Application Security Testing\"","created":"2025-12-16T16:14:35Z","pr":228,"url":"https://github.com/CiscoLearning/ciscou-tutorial-content/pull/228#issuecomment-3661333874"}
{"body":"Hi @jabelk , @qsnyder , and @kiskander , I have finished editing the OpenShift Pipelines tutorial (#216). From an editorial perspective, the tutorial is in very good shape, but this post still needs a technical review. If there are any significant content changes as a result of that review, please let me know and I can do a follow-up edit on those revised portions.

Here are the seven comments I left overall regarding issues that I could not resolve on my own:

--Red Hat OpenShift CodeReady Containers (CRC) is the former name for what is now called OpenShift Local (https://openshift.guide/getting-started/openshift-local.html). This tutorial referred to both names interchangeably, so for the sake of consistency and to reflect the updated branding, I changed all occurrences to OpenShift Local where the content appears to be clearly referring to the application – except in the first occurrence of the step 3 topic, where it refers to both the new and old names (“Red Hat OpenShift Local—formerly known as OpenShift CodeReady Containers (CRC)”). I left occurrences of “CRC” as is where the content appeared to be referring to CodeReady Containers configuration within the application. All “crc” commands also have been left as is because they are still used in the rebranded application.

During your technical review, please carefully check all these occurrences to make sure that I didn’t inadvertently change it to “Local” where it still should say “CRC,” or vice versa. Regardless, any references to the overall application should say “OpenShift Local,” not “OpenShift CRC” (except in the aforementioned occurrence in step 3).

--The “Download the OpenShift Local Installation Package” subtopic of the step 3 file includes this note: “For comprehensive documentation on setting up CRC, visit the [Getting Started with CRC guide](https://crc.dev/docs/getting-started/).” OpenShift CRC (CodeReady Containers) is the former name for what is now called OpenShift Local. Given that rebranding (while recognizing that “crc” is still used in the commands), isn’t there a more recent Getting Started guide that could be linked to that reflects the name change? One example could be https://developers.redhat.com/products/openshift-local/getting-started, but I see that web page also includes a link to the “Using CRC” section of the same web page that the note currently links to. 

--Step 3 has four occurrences of “master” in command syntax. As part of its inclusive language effort, Cisco prefers not to use the term “master” where possible (especially when used as “master/slave,” which is not the case here). Something like “primary” or “control” is preferred, depending on context. In this case, if “master” is part of the command syntax built into OpenShift, the occurrences should be left as is. However, if you’re using “master” here on your own as part of this tutorial scenario, consider changing the term accordingly. 

--In step 3, the “Install the OpenShift Pipelines Operator” subtopic includes this sentence: “To connect to the console, enter the following URL in your browser—https://console-openshift-console.apps-crc.testing/—or enter crc console in the terminal of your server.” The URL in GitHub by default includes a link, but that link directs to a “Server Not Found” page. If possible, please remove this link, or if you prefer to keep it, make sure it goes to an actual working web page.

--In the step 5 figure (pipeline_trigger.png), change “OpenShift CRC” to “OpenShift Local”.

--The “Configure the Shared Workspace” subtopic of step 5 includes this sentence: “The following PVC configuration file references the name of the PV, specifies the namespace—mlops-lab in this case—and requests 10 Mi of storage.” To avoid any potential confusion for readers, please spell out the expanded term in place of “Mi” in this context. For example, it is referring to “mebibytes (MiB),” which could make sense here given that it’s a unit of measurement used in computer data storage? “Mi” is a commonly used measurement unit abbreviation for “miles,” which doesn’t seem to apply at all in the context of this tutorial.

--Same type of issue as in step 3: The “Trigger a PipelineRun Using a Webhook” subtopic of step 7 includes this sentence: “From the CRC/server terminal, send an HTTP POST request with a JSON body to http://el-mlops-listener-mlops-lab.apps-crc.testing/ by using curl.” The URL in GitHub by default includes a link, but that link directs to a “Server Not Found” page. If possible, please remove this link, or if you prefer to keep it, make sure it goes to an actual working web page.

Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns about the edits.

{"body":"@kyle-winters and @qsnyder , a few points related to this change and the tutorial:

1) The tutorial as currently written has NO references at all to Cisco Hypershield. If it is going to be referenced in the secondary title description, it should be mentioned at least somewhere in the tutorial content itself. I highly recommend adding at least a reference in the step 2 topic. Even beginning with something like \"To understand what the Cisco Hypershield underlying technology eBPF does ...\" would be an improvement, though Hypershield also should be mentioned at least a few times elsewhere in the post. Otherwise, it feels a bit misleading to tease Hypershield in the secondary title and never mention it again in the content.

2) The description change is (mostly) fine, but strictly speaking, Cisco corporate style is to avoid using the name Cisco and its associated products in the form of a possessive. You could change \"Cisco Hypershield's\" to \"the Cisco Hypershield\" to conform to this rule.

3) I also noticed on Cisco U. that the tutorial title is \"Introduction to Extended Berkeley Packet Filter (eBPF)\". The long-standing Cisco rule (since at least 2008, when I started) is that the titles of all Cisco learning content should include either an acronym or its expanded term, but NOT both. In this case, the title should be either \"Introduction to eBPF\" (the original title when I edited this post) or \"Introduction to Extended Berkeley Packet Filter\".

{"body":"@kyle-winters and @qsnyder , one more point to add to #3 in my previous comment: I recommend changing the tutorial title to \"Introduction to Extended Berkeley Packet Filter,\" even though the original title when I edited it was \"Introduction to eBPF.\" The revised secondary description now refers to \"eBPF\" (the original description used \"extended Berkeley Packet Filter\"), so using the expanded term in the main title would have you covered on both the acronym and its expansion in your title block while still following Cisco style on titles in learning content.","created":"2025-02-21T18:10:10Z","pr":116,"url":"https://github.com/CiscoLearning/ciscou-tutorial-content/pull/116#issuecomment-2675228245"}
{"body":"Thanks, @kyle-winters ... and of course, you are correct in noting that, strictly speaking, eBPF no longer stands for \"extended Berkeley Packet Filter.\" (Frankly, I had forgotten that the expanded term is no longer officially used.) Consequently, I would have recommended that the first text mention of eBPF also include an explanation that it either evolved from or is the successor to Berkeley Packet Filter (BPF), or that it originally was known as extended Berkeley Packet Filter. But I see from your revisions to the step 3 that you have already elaborated on its origins, so you're covered in that regard.

One minor recommended change in the first paragraph: The second sentence should read: \"At first, the acronym stood for \"extended Berkeley Packet Filter\", but now it is just \"eBPF\" as its own term.\" (comma after \"first\" and lowercase \"extended\") Aside from that, I think you're good to go!

{"body":"Hi @kyle-winters , I looked over the revised step 6 content and made just a couple of very minor edits. It otherwise looks good. Aside from that: 
1) Just to confirm, the #5 scenario that was in the previous version of step 6 (\"Prompt Injection and Misinformation\") is no longer in the revised version?
2) I quickly reviewed the other steps in the tutorial and did not readily notice any changes elsewhere in the post. Did you change any content other than in step 6?

{"body":"Hi @jhunter56 , regarding your comment about the use of \"UCS\" throughout this tutorial:

Cisco Branding (with upper management's blessing) recently changed its long-standing style and has decided to do away with acronyms in association with its products and features, including UCS, in general references to the product or feature name. However, the acronyms are still fine when referring to GUI elements (such as buttons and check boxes), filenames, folders, and commands and output that happen to use the acronym.

In your case, for example, step 5 currently begins: 

\"Next, we will create an NTP policy to define the NTP server for our Cisco UCS domain.

\"Back on the Policies page, click **Create Policy**. Use the filter to select **UCS Domain** again. In the list of policies, select **NTP** and click **Start**.\"

Following the new Cisco policy, the first occurrence of \"UCS\" here, in the first paragraph, should be spelled out as \"Unified Computing System\"; optionally, you can also drop \"Cisco\" because the full name already has been referenced earlier in the tutorial. However, in the second paragraph, \"UCS Domain\" (in boldface) should stay as is because \"UCS Domain\" is the actual name of the GUI element, as shown in the accompanying screenshot.

SNMP and DNS are perfectly fine to use -- the new Cisco policy does not apply to well-established acronyms -- but for these two acronyms, Cisco style is still to include the expanded term on the first mention only, and then go with the acronym thereafter. (There are some exceptions where acronyms do not need to be expanded even on first mention, but they currently don't apply to SNMP and DNS.)

Also: I noticed that this tutorial has at least one reference to \"CCO,\" presumably for \"Cisco Connection Online.\" Per long-established Cisco style, not a recent change, do not use acronyms in which the \"C\" stands for \"Cisco,\" unless referring to Cisco certifications (CCIE, CCNA, and so on). In this case, simply use the name instead of the acronym.

Let me know if you have any questions. Thanks! --Matt","created":"2024-11-06T21:48:06Z","pr":75,"url":"https://github.com/CiscoLearning/ciscou-tutorial-content/pull/75#issuecomment-2460850148"}
{"body":"Hi @jhunter56 and @qsnyder , regarding #3 on the last comment regarding boldfacing: You are _partially_ correct regarding its usage. The longstanding rule on Cisco learning content, dating back to at least 2008 (when I started), is to boldface the name of a GUI element if it is associated with a direct instruction -- a direct command in the imperative voice to do something. (Do not use boldfacing if the GUI element forms part of descriptive text.) This rule applies to any direct instruction, not just clicking a button or checking a box; telling the user in the imperative voice to expand a menu or navigate to one or more tabs also falls under this rule. For example: \"Navigate to **Users** > **Rules**.\" Expand the **Configure** menu. However: \"From the Operate tab, click the **Save** button.\" (In the latter case, \"Operate\" should not be boldfaced because in this context, the user is already there and is not being instructed to navigate to that tab.)
Also, per Cisco style, use \"click\" instead of \"click on\" -- for example, \"Click the **Save** button,\" not \"Click on the **Save** button.\"
I can tweak step 3 to conform to these rules if you wish, but I just wanted to provide some clarification on why the boldfacing was applied in that way.
Thanks! --Matt","created":"2024-10-29T15:27:17Z","pr":73,"url":"https://github.com/CiscoLearning/ciscou-tutorial-content/pull/73#issuecomment-2444604495"}
{"body":"One point to add to the previous comment for clarification: Boldfacing should not be used when the direct instruction does not specify, for example, the button name or the information to be added to a field. For example, in the sentence \"Copy and save the information in the Device ID and Claim Code fields,\" \"information\" should not be in boldface. However, if the sentence were to read \"Copy and save **123456** in the Device ID and Claim Code fields,\" \"123456\" would be in boldface.
