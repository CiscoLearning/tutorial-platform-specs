QUERIES:
1. Should we change the title to \"CCIE Automation: Troubleshooting Python Code in Cisco NSO Python-and-Template Service Packages\"?

2.  The duration for Step-6 (Congratulations), line 51, says 2:30 min. However, typically the final step (Congratulations) is 1 min in duration. Should we change it in line 51 and update it in the total duration (line 6) to \"58m30s\"?

5. Last bullet under \"What You'll Need\": I removed \"Cisco\" before \"NSO\" as \"Cisco NSO\" was already introduced in the first instance

QUERY: 
Do we need to add the legal disclaimer to the end of this step (see below)? Or is there a sandbox-specific disclaimer we should use?

7/18 post:

Hi, @jabelk,

I completed an edit of tutorial #160 (ciscou-tutorial-content/tc-nso-troubleshooting-template at tc-nso-troubleshooting-template · CiscoLearning/ciscou-tutorial-content)

This time, rather than emailing comments and leaving them in the commit message body, I inserted them at the end of each step (commented out). Let me know if this works for you. I posted a note and screenshot to you in Webex.

Thanks,
Jill

QUERY:
1. The first three bullets are phrased as questions, so I added \"?\" Is this OK? Or should opening bullets not be phrased as questions?
- What is retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)?

- What are the components of a RAG pipeline?

- What is a benchmark?

2. \"Pip package manager\" is redundant (Pip Installs Packages). Should we change it to \"Pip, the Python package manager\"

3. Should we expand \"VS Code\" (Visual Studio Code) or is that a commonly understood acronym?

4. To make the last item parallel to the others, and to clarify its meaning, should we change it to \"Ubuntu 22.04 (tested environment) ...\"?

Removed several exclamation points.

Two examples:
Make sure to have the 1B model running on your Ollama server before running the script!

Removed the first sentence to avoid redundancy:

Some restructuring is required for the message to meet OpenAI's API requirements.

The prompt is inserted into a dictionary, to meet OpenAI's API requirements:
